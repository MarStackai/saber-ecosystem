## Test Commands Available:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Run admin tests only
npm run test:admin

# Run partner tests only
npm run test:partner

# Interactive test runner
./run-tests.sh

# Quick smoke test
echo "4" | ./run-tests.sh
```

## Next Steps Priority:

1. **Fix Admin Dashboard** - Ensure H1 renders with "Admin Dashboard" text
2. **Fix Tenders API** - Create/fix `/api/admin/projects` endpoint
3. **Implement SharePoint** - Add invitation validation and document storage
4. **Complete Form Flow** - Connect to D1 database and implement submission
5. **Add R2 Storage** - Configure and implement file uploads

## Testing Process Workflow:

### For Admin:
1. Navigate to /admin
2. View partners list → applications → approved → analytics
3. Create and manage tenders
4. Upload and organize documents
5. View partner projects and details

### For Partners:
1. Visit homepage → Click "Submit Application"
2. Enter invitation code (TEST001, TEST2024, or DEMO2024)
3. Fill multi-step application form
4. Upload required documents
5. Submit application
6. Receive confirmation

## Known Test Data:
- **Invitation Codes**: TEST001, TEST2024, DEMO2024
- **Frontend URL**: http://localhost:4200
- **Backend URL**: http://localhost:8787
