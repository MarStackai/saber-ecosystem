## Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive security architecture and access control framework for the Saber Business Operations Platform. The security design implements defense-in-depth principles with multiple layers of protection, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive business data and partner information.

### Key Security Principles
- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify with continuous authentication
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Least Privilege**: Users only have access to resources they need
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit with proper key management
- **Compliance**: GDPR, UK Data Protection Act, and industry regulations compliance
